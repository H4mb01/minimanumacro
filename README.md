## Customize Default Hotkeys
For customizing the hotkeys for recording, abort, confirm and toggle drag you have to use settings.json.  
Please note that you have to know the virtual key number of any key you want to use and insert them in dezimal (not Hex).

## Additional Important Information
- Every keypress recorded as a macro will be stored in readable JSON Data on your device.
Please keep this in mind when using a macro to login with a password.
- No logging will be recorded
- Via GUI deleted macros will be deleted permanently and cannot be restored
- If you want to edit a macro after recording you can edit it in the JSON file directly, but to apply the changes you have to restart the application
- Please only edit the JSON files if you know what you are doing. You could potentially lose all your macros permanently if you do something wrong :)
